# Base Image
FROM ghcr.io/ublue-os/aurora:stable

## Other possible base images include:
# FROM ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite:latest
# FROM ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin-nvidia:stable
# 
# ... and so on, here are more base images
# Universal Blue Images: https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/packages
# Fedora base image: quay.io/fedora/fedora-bootc:41
# CentOS base images: quay.io/centos-bootc/centos-bootc:stream10

### [IM]MUTABLE /opt
## Some bootable images, like Fedora, have /opt symlinked to /var/opt, in order to
## make it mutable/writable for users. However, some packages write files to this directory,
## thus its contents might be wiped out when bootc deploys an image, making it troublesome for
## some packages. Eg, google-chrome, docker-desktop.
##
## Uncomment the following line if one desires to make /opt immutable and be able to be used
## by the package manager.

# RUN rm /opt && mkdir /opt

### MODIFICATIONS
## make modifications desired in your image and install packages by modifying the build.sh script
## the following RUN directive does all the things required to run "build.sh" as recommended.
RUN dnf install -y \
    linux-firmware-mediatek \
    iwl7260-firmware \
    iwlwifi-dvm-firmware \
    iwlwifi-mvm-firmware \

    NetworkManager-wifi \
